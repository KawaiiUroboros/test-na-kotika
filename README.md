# test-na-kotika

## Purpose

This project demonstrates a simple HTML page with two sections:
1. A signature screen where users can type their name and see an animated "signature" of their name.
2. A parallax header with cat-themed slides.

## Instructions

1. Copy the provided HTML code into a file named `index.html`.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the page.
3. On the first page, type your name in the input field and click the "Sign" button.
4. The signature page will fade out, and the "Какой ты котик" page with the parallax header and slides will appear.
